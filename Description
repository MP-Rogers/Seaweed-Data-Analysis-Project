PROJECT IN PROGRESS. ITS INCOMPLETE. REMEMBER TO UPDATE THIS WHEN YOU ARE DONE

This Repository contains information on the project. This project covers some analysis into the dataset taken from: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00618. 
All Credit goes to the Original Authors and collectors of the data.

The dataset contains the (binomial) species of seaweed, the Phylum, a number of chemical parameters, light intensity, and the specific growth rate of the seaweed.

Goals for the project include:
      + Reviewing what I know so far and learning new stuff
      + Clean/Tidy The Dataset as necessary.
      + Perform exploratory data analysis and ansk questions
      + Are there significant differences in growth rate with phylum or genus?
      + Which group grows fastest
      + Which parameters are most important to growth rate
            + Can the above be modelled linearly
      + Visualize Results
      + Report on the above with R Markdown or a similar package
      + Publish on Github
      + Look back on what i could do differently, whats left to learn.
